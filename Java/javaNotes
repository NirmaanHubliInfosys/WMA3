what is java programming?
Syntax of Java?
what are the features of java?
how to installation eclipse IDE?

piblic:is an access specifier that declared the main method()as unprotected this is similar to c++ public modifier

void :does not return any value
static:does not change

java control statements/control flow in java?
the stmts in the code are excecuted accroding to the order in which they appear.however,java provides stmts that can be used to control the flow of java code.such statements are called control flow statements.


three statements?
1)Decision making statements
2)loop statements
3)jump statements


1)Decision making statements
  a)if statements:four types if-statements

  if(4>2){
    sysout("true");
  }
  1)simple if statements
  2)if-else statements 
  3)if else-if ladder
  4) Nested statment
  b)switch statements
  *cases cannot be duplicate
  *default stmt is excecuted when any of the case does'nt match the value of expression

  syntax:
  swicth(expression){
    case value1:
    statments 1;
    break;
    .
    .
    .

    case value N;
    statment n;
    break;
    default:
    default statment;
  }

2)loop statements
a)do while loop
b)while loop
c)for loop
d)for-each loop 

for loop:
syntax:
for(initialization;condition;increament/decreament){
    //block of statements;
}

EX:
public class Calculation {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
int sum=0;
for(int i=1;i<=3;i++) {
	sum=sum+i;
}
System.out.println("the sum of first 3 natural number is "+sum);
	}

}


FOR EACH:
SYNTAX:
for(data_type var:array_name/collection_name){
    //statements
}
ex:
syout("for each loop")

while condition:
while condition is checked at the start of the loop.if the condition is true,then the loop body will be excecuted;otherwise the statements after the loop will be excecuted:

syntax:
while(condition){
  //stmts
}


jump statements
break and continue;


break statements
ex:
public class BreakExampl1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for(int i=0;i<=10;i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
			if(i==8) {
				break;
			}
		}
	}

}
continue;
public class Continue {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for(int i=0;i<=2;i++) {
			for(int j=i;j<=5;j++) {
				if(j==4) {
					continue;
				}
				System.out.println(j);
			}
		
			
		}
	}

}

Arrays variables
variable is a name of memory location.
there are three types variables in java
1)local
2)instance
3)static

local:a variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable.

you can use this variable only within that method and other methods in the class
local variable cannot be defined with the "static" keyword



instance:
a variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method,is called an instance variable it is not declared as static

static:
a variable is declared as static  is called a static variable.it cannot be local

ex:
public class A {

	static int m=100;//static variable
	
	void method() {
		int n=90;//local variable
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int data=50;//instance variable
	}
}

typecasting
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myInt = 9;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

    System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
    System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0
  }
}


public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double myDouble = 9.78d;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int

    System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
    System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
  }
}


methods in java?
a method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation

advantages:
reusablity of code.
we write a method once and use it many times.


what is the constructor?
constructor is a special type of member function/method which is used to initialize the object.
constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.

it is called when an instance of the class is created.

there are two types of constructor?
1)Default constructor(no-arguments)
2)parameterized constructor

Rules:
1)constructor name must be the same as its class name
2)a constructor must have no explict retur type
3)java constructor cannot be abstract ,static ,final and synchorized
